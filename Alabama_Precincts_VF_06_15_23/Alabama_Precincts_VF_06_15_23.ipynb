    "- Received a request for a block assignment file linking census blocks to Alabama's post-redistricting precincts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "- Load in a geocoded voterfile.\n",
    "- Remove voters without a precinct assignment and those for which the county of the geocoded block does not match the county tied to their record (2,443 individuals).\n",
    "- Append the 3-digit County FIPs to the precinct name.\n",
    "- Group the voterfile by block geoid20, recording the all the different precinct names, and the number of times they occur, for every individual geocoded to a particular block.\n",
    "- For every block, iterate over the precinct names and counts values and assign the \"best_prec\" to the precinct that occurs most frequently. Ties are broken by using the first occurring precinct.\n",
    "- Add in remaining block geoid20s for the state, fill other fields for these blocks as \"NO VOTERS IN VOTERFILE\".\n",
    "- Clean column names and export to csv.\n",
