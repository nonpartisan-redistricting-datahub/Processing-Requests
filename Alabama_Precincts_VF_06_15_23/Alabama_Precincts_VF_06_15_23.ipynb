    "## Background:\n",
    "- Received a request for a block assignment file linking census blocks to Alabama's post-redistricting precincts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "- Load in a geocoded voterfile.\n",
    "- Remove voters without a precinct assignment and those for which the county of the geocoded block does not match the county tied to their record (2,443 individuals).\n",
    "- Append the 3-digit County FIPs to the precinct name.\n",
    "- Group the voterfile by block geoid20, recording all the different precinct names, and the number of times they occur, for every individual geocoded to a particular block.\n",
    "- For every block, iterate over the precinct names and counts values and assign the \"best_prec\" to the precinct that occurs most frequently. Ties are broken by using the first occurring precinct. For example, if there are three voters geocoded to block 1001 and two of these voters have \"Precinct A\" as an assignment and one voter has \"Precinct B\" as an assignment, \"Precinct A\" would be the best assignment, \"unq_precs\" would be 2, and \"matched_precs\" would be {\"Precinct A\":2, \"Precinct B\":1}.\n",
    "- Add in remaining block geoid20s for the state, fill other fields for these blocks as \"NO VOTERS IN VOTERFILE\".\n",
    "- Clean column names and export to csv.\n",
