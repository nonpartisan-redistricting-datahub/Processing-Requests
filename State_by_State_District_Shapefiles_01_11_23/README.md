# State by State District Shapefiles

## Background:
- We received a request for standardized, district shapefiles by state.
- These are similar to the national shapefiles we are hosting, but filtered down to every state.

## Approach:
- Download national cong, sldl and sldu shapefiles
- Filter by state for each of the 3 levels and export

## Links to Download Raw Files
- Create a "raw-from-source" folder and add the following files:
    - [2022 National Congressional Districts](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/national-congressional-districts-for-2022/)
    - [2022 National State Legislative Districts Upper Level](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/national-state-legislative-upper-house-districts-for-2022/)
    - [2022 National State Legislative Districts Lower Level](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/national-state-legislative-lower-house-districts-for-2022/)
